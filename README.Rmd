This program calculates bioclimatic indices and fluxes (radiation, evapotranspiration, soil moisture) for use in studies of ecosystem function, species distribution, and vegetation dynamics under changing climate scenarios. Predictions are based on a minimum of required inputs: latitude, precipitation, air temperature, and cloudiness.


## Installation

You can install the released version of splash from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

``` r
install.packages("splash")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

<!-- You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with: -->
``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("villegar/splash")
```
