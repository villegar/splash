Description: This program calculates bioclimatic indices and fluxes (radiation, 
    evapotranspiration, soil moisture) for use in studies of ecosystem function, 
    species distribution, and vegetation dynamics under changing climate 
    scenarios. Predictions are based on a minimum of required inputs: latitude, 
    precipitation, air temperature, and cloudiness.
